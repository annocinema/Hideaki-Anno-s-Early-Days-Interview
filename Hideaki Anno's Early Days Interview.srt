1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,400
[About the days he was making an independent film]
There was an event called DAICON 3, the 20th Japan SF Convention.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,700
I got the offer for the opening animation.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Powered suits and stuff like that would be in the animation, so they asked me to try.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,000
I wasn't so interested in it, but Yamaga was very enthusiastic and wanted to do it.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,900
No one knew about cel animation at the time.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There were only two staff members who had seen cels for cel animation before.
[Anno was in charge of the mecha, and Takao Akai was in charge of the original character drawing.]

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,900
I was drawing with Akai under such circumstances.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,800
We managed to finish the animation and it was delivered on the day of the convention.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Mr. Miyatake and Mr. Kawamori of Studio Nue were at the convention by the way.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,500
At the time, I was working on a tokusatsu film, so I couldn't spend a lot of time on the opening animation.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
[In charge of designing mecha and monsters]
Only Yamaga went there.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Next year there was a science fiction convention called DAICON 4, and I was supposed to make an opening animation for it.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,200
To do it with the same way we had before would have been bad, since no one knew how to do it.
So I decided to study the professional method.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,400
How was it that professionals make animation?
It was worth going to study that.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:48,600
For that reason, I worked on the Macross TV series when the special effects work calmed down.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I was working under Mr. Itano,
[In charge of starring, directing, and design]

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I was so surprised to see how sloppy professional animator's work was.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,800
I was studying by observation at that time, I wondered how they were making animations.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Then Mr. Itano showed up and piled up the cuts. He said, "You can choose any of these cut bags and then retouch it.".

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's why I did drawing.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I don't have any experiences in video. I still work with messy lines.

22
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,800
And then I've been assigned to the mecha group.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was working under Mr. Itano on the Macross TV series for 3 months.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,800
But I needed to make an opening animation for DAICON 4, so I stopped it halfway.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:52,300
I went back to Osaka and made the opening animation for DAICON 4 by making use of that sloppy professional experience.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Amazing. So that's why the world burned.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Her Majesty Kushana. Banzai! Banzai!

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Burn them! What's the matter with you, monster? Can't you fire at once?

29
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:54,100
I had a different plan at first. Kushana wasn't coming by a tank, but walking beside the Giant God Warrior.

30
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:03,800
They were walking along, while the pieces of melted skin were dropping in front of Kushana.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It also had a scene of the Giant God Warrior battling against Ohmus.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:20,800
That last shot of the Giant God Warrior wasn't so underwhelming, it's like he turns his face to the sky like this and shoots.

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And he collapsed in a standing pose.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,300
However we both worked too slowly

35
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,800
I mean, both the storyboard by Miyazaki and my key frames got finished too late.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,800
The scale was gradually reduced, and in the end it became a film like it is now.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Work properly buddy!

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Did it move forward?

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Come out!

40
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Anno, he is the most reliable person among the staff I know.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,600
The reason for this is that he is a strange person. There are many things he can't do.

42
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,800
There are so many things he can't do, but in exchange what he can do is perfect and beautiful.

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,800
So I ask him what he can do. I don't ask him what he can't do.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,700
He does the perfect job when you ask him to do what he can. So, I can say he is a truly reliable person.

45
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Well, metaphorically speaking, Anno-kun is like a nuclear weapon.

46
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,700
If you use it incorrectly, radioactivity will contaminate your base as well.

47
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,100
However, if you use it well in the place where you use it, the war will end in one shot.

48
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:25,000
He is like a god who brings together the expanding fronts of animation and brings a wonderful end of the war with a single light.

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,200
[Depiction of mecha for Honneamise]
I try to put value in the first impression that I received.

50
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Whether it's from a film or reality, airplanes are like this, smoke is like this, rockets are like this.

51
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,100
I tried to put those first impressions on the film as they are.

52
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,700
So it's not that so-called animation symbolic deformation,

53
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,700
But a deformation that values the real thing more.

54
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:49,800
I avoided making it more powerful by speeding it up. I also avoided manga-like images.

55
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,400
At any rate, I wanted to make it as close to the real thing as possible.

56
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,800
That's why I went to the USA and saw the shuttle launch.

57
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,800
I also joined the boot camp for new recruits conducted by the JSDF,

58
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,800
to see and touch real tanks and planes.

59
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,200
Only the depiction of the war, as you know I can't go to see the war.

60
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,800
For the image of the scene of the war, I refer to the actual literature books,

61
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the texts of the war memorials, and the actual recording films.
